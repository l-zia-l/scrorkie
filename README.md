# Scrorkie
### The Autoscroller for Musicians Who Hate Frills (and subscriptions).

Welcome to **Scrorkie**, the digital songbook and autoscroller I built because I was tired of my paper charts blowing away and my phone screen timing out mid-chorus. 

Scrorkie is built for the stage, the bedroom practice session, and the "I just wrote this and need to see it while I play" moments.

## Why Scrorkie?
Most tab sites are cluttered with ads, pop-ups, and "Subscribe Now!" banners. Scrorkie is the opposite. 

* **Autoscroll that Works:** Control the speed with your keyboard or simple UI buttons.
* **Zen Mode:** As soon as you start scrolling, the UI drifts away. It’s just you and the music.
* **Zero Cloud BS:** Your songs are stored locally on your device. No account, no login, no tracking.

## How to Use
- **Click:** [Scrorkie](https://l-zia-l.github.io/scrorkie)
- **Paste:** Throw your lyrics and chords into the editor. (Pro-tip: Use spaces and the Tab key to align chords).
- **Scroll:** Hit "Get Scrollin'" and find your perfect speed.
- **Save:** Your songs are automatically saved to your "Songbook" (Library).
